Description: Finds the k nearest neighbours in a dataset of specified points, 
  adding the option to wrap certain variables on a torus.  The user chooses
  the algorithm to use to find the nearest neighbours. Three such algorithms,
  provided by the packages 'RANN' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=RANN>, 
  'RANN.L1' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=RANN.L1>, and 'nabor' 
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=nabor>, are suggested.
